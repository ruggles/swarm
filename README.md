Swarm is a small game being made in HTML5 Canvas & JS

It takes little bits of RTS mechanics (individual units, resource gathering,
buildings) and simplifies it down into almost arcadey, few minute chunks.

It's very much in progress, but feel free to play with it and let me
know what you think.

When I feel it's more ready, it'll be up on my website, ruggl.es in a
more easily consumable form.
